CogExTools were developed by [Peter Jurica](http://bsp.brain.riken.jp/~juricap/)
at the [Cichocki Laboratory for Advanced Brain Signal Processing](http://bsp.brain.riken.jp/) 
at [RIKEN Brain Science Institute](http://www.brain.riken.jp) in Japan.

Screening for cognitive impairment is becoming more important as the worldâ€™s population grows older. Most of mental fitness examinations are performed by humans, which instruct and subsequently grade the execution of a cognitive exercise task. By involving computers in both roles, instructing and scoring, we aim to increase the precision and replicability of the examination.
